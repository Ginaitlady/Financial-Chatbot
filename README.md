# 💰 Financial Chatbot

A **deep learning-powered chatbot** designed to answer financial questions using a **hybrid model architecture**.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a sophisticated chatbot that can handle two distinct types of user queries:

- **Dictionary/Keyword Questions:**  
  Simple requests for the definition of a financial term  
  *(e.g., “What is inflation?”)*

- **General/Knowledge Questions:**  
  More complex, conversational queries that require a generated response  
  *(e.g., “How can I start investing in stocks?”)*

To achieve this, the chatbot uses a **two-stage hybrid model**:

1. **Intent Classifier (Bidirectional LSTM):**  
   Classifies the user's input to determine if it's a *dictionary* question or a *general* question.

2. **Response Generator (Sequence-to-Sequence):**  
   Based on the classification, the system either retrieves a predefined definition or uses a generative Seq2Seq model to create a novel answer.

## ⚙️ How It Works: Architecture

When a user inputs a question, it goes through the following pipeline:

### 🧠 1. Classification
- The input is tokenized using the **`lstm_tokenizer`**.
- It's fed into the **`bidirectional_LSTM.h5`** model, which outputs a score.

### 🔀 2. Branching Logic

#### If **score > 0.5** → *Dictionary Query*
- The system identifies the query as a request for a definition.  
- It searches the **`keyword_dict.pkl`** for a matching financial term.  
- It returns the predefined definition associated with that term.

#### If **score ≤ 0.5** → *Generative Query*
- The system identifies the query as a general, knowledge-based question.  
- The input is tokenized using the **`seq2seq_tokenizer`** (*Final_Tokenizer*).  
- It's processed by the **`chatbot.h5`** (*Sequence-to-Sequence*) model, which generates an answer token-by-token.  
- The final generated sentence is cleaned and returned to the user.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow & Keras** — For building and serving both the LSTM and Seq2Seq models.  
- **TensorFlow Datasets** — For `SubwordTextEncoder` tokenization.  
- **NumPy** — For numerical operations and sequence padding.  
- **Pickle** — For loading the keyword dictionary.
